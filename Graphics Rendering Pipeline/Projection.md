- After projection the models are in _clip coordinates_
- Are called projections because even though they transform one volume into another, the z-coordinate is stored in a z-buffer

## Orthographic Projection
- Transforms the rectangular box of view volume into a unit cube
- Parallel lines remain parallel after it
## Perspective Projection
- Mimics the way a human perceives the object size
